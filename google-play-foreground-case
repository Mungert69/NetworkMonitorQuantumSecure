The Network Monitor Agent app is designed to enable users to monitor their network by adding hosts through methods such as ping or HTTPS connect. This app utilizes a foreground service to regularly poll these hosts and transmit the monitoring data to the Quantum Secure Service. The foreground service is essential for the continuous operation of these polls and data transmissions, ensuring reliability and timely updates for the user. It is explicitly designed to run persistently in the foreground to maintain active monitoring, with the provision that it can be started or stopped exclusively at the user's discretion.

This design choice underscores our commitment to giving users full control over the monitoring service, allowing them to initiate or halt the monitoring process according to their needs. The accompanying video demonstrates the process of authenticating the agent for secure data transmission and logging into the Quantum Secure Service to access the monitored data. It further illustrates the functionality that enables users to activate or deactivate the agent, thereby controlling the start and stop actions of the foreground service.

This foreground service is crucial for the app's core functionality, enabling real-time monitoring and ensuring that the data collected is both current and accurate. By running in the foreground, it guarantees that the user remains informed of the monitoring status and can interact with the service as needed, highlighting our dedication to transparency and user agency.
